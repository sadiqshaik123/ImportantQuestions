Given a string containing the words and dates, the task is to find the number of distinct years mentioned. 
Note: Assuming that the date will be in ‘DD-MM-YYYY’ format and the string will end with a full stop.

Examples:  

Input:  str = “UN was established on 24-10-1945. India got freedom on 15-08-1947.”
Output: 2
Explanation: 2 distinct years i.e. 1945 and 1947 have been referenced.

Input: str = “Soon after the world war 2 ended on 02-09-1945. The UN was established on 24-10-1945.”
Output: 1
Explanation: Only 1 Year, i.e 1945 has been referenced .


Approach: 

Start traversing the string.
Check if the current character is a digit. Store it in another string, i.e. dateString.
Check if the current character is ‘-‘, then remove the characters stored in the dateString.
Check if the length of the dateString is equal to 4, then it means that it is a year.
Store that year in an unordered_set.
Return the size of the unordered_set as it contains only unique values.
Note: For Python, ‘(\d+-\d+-\d+)’ can be used in place of ‘[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]’ as an alternate regular expression.

Below is the implementation of the above approach:
