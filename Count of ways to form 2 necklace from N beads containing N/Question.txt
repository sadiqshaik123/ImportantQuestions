Given a positive even integer N denoting the number of distinct beads, the task is to find the number of ways to make 2 necklaces having exactly N/2 beads.

Examples:

Input: N = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: 
The only possible way to make two necklaces is that {1 | 2}.

Input: N = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: 
The possible ways to make two necklaces are {(1, 2) | (3, 4)}, {(1, 3) | (2, 4)}, and {(1, 4) | (2, 3)}.


Approach: The problem can be solved by using the concept of circular permutation and combinatorics. Follow the steps below to solve the problem:

Define a function, say factorial for calculating the factorial of a number, by following the steps below:
Base Case: If n = 0, then return 1.
If n != 0, then recursively call the function and return n * factorial(n-1).
Initialize a variable, say, ans as C(N, N/2), that is the number of ways to choose N/2 beads from N beads.
Since the necklace is circular, the number of ways to permute N/2 beads are factorial(N/2 -1), so multiply the value of ans by factorial(N/2 -1)*factorial(N/2-1) since there are two necklaces.
Now divide the ans by 2. Because of symmetrical distribution. For eg, For N=2, the distribution {1 | 2} and {2 | 1} are considered the same.
Finally, after completing the above steps, print the value of ans as the answer.
Below is the implementation of the above approach:
